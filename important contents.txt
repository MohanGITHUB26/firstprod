  
1).Difference between unmetered SSD and unlimited SSD?

 Both an unmetered SSD disk and an unlimited SSD disk can offer fast storage and performance for your data and applications. However, the main difference between the 
two is in their usage restrictions.An unmetered SSD disk generally means that there is no set limit on the amount of data you can store, but there may be limitations 
on the amount of data you can transfer or access during a certain time period. This can be useful for users who need to store large amounts of data and do not need to 
access it all at once.An unlimited SSD disk, on the other hand, generally means that there are no usage restrictions on the amount of data you can store or access. 
This can be useful for users who need to store and access large amounts of data frequently and without interruption.Ultimately, the choice between an unmetered SSD 
disk and an unlimited SSD disk will depend on your specific needs and usage patterns. If you have high storage requirements and need to access your data frequently, 
an unlimited SSD disk may be the better choice. If, on the other hand, you have high storage requirements but do not need to access your data frequently, an unmetered 
SSD disk may be the better choice.
